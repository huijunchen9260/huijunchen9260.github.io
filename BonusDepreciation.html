<p>How do large corporate tax deductions affect firm investment, aggregate productivity, and the business cycle?
I answer this question by developing a novel dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model where firms face credit market imperfections and idiosyncratic productivity shocks.
In my model, firms&#8217; investment decisions are distorted by collateralized borrowing and corporate taxation, and investment expenditures can be deducted from taxable income through targeted or untargeted accelerated depreciation policies.
My model quantitatively replicates the empirical estimates of the short-run investment elasticities to changes in the deduction policies across firm size.
I show that raising deduction can reduce the severity and persistence of recessions by alleviating capital misallocation for productive firms.
Applying my model to the policies in 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, I found that the targeted policy is 50 percent more effective than the untargeted policy in stimulating aggregate output.
Furthermore, combining both policies reduces the overall effectiveness by 13 percent, revealing potential inefficiencies in current US tax policy implementation.</p>
