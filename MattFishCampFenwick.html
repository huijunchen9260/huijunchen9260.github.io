<p><strong>Date:</strong> June 11–12, 2025 — <em>Fenwick Island, Delaware</em></p>
<p>There’s no sales tax in Delaware.
That became our main motivation to dine across the state line during our time in Ocean City.</p>
<p>We found this place called <strong>Matt’s Fish Camp</strong>, and they had an amazing happy hour—<strong>buck-a-shuck oysters</strong> and <strong>50-cent clams</strong> from 4 PM to 6 PM.
I’ve never seen prices like that before.
So of course, we went there twice—once wasn’t enough. We went for both happy hour and dinner.</p>
<h2 id="swordfish-for-dinner">Swordfish for Dinner</h2>
<p>We tried the swordfish as our main dish.
It was meaty and lean. I personally liked it, but my partner wasn’t a fan.</p>

<h2 id="solving-the-fi-salmon-mystery">Solving the &#8220;FI&#8221; Salmon Mystery</h2>
<p>On the first day, I noticed the salmon was labeled as coming from &#8220;FI,&#8221; which didn’t match any U.S. state abbreviation.
We figured it out the next day at <em>Sea Shell City</em>, a nearby gift shop—<strong>FI stands for Fenwick Island</strong>.</p>
<p>So naturally, we ordered the &#8220;FI&#8221; salmon the next day.
As always, salmon didn’t disappoint me.</p>

<h2 id="oysters-and-clams-so-fresh">Oysters and Clams: So Fresh</h2>
<p>We ordered a dozen oysters and a dozen clams.
They were unbelievably fresh. That’s when I realized the weird aftertaste I’d experienced with oysters from Whole Foods in Columbus wasn’t normal.</p>
<p>Each oyster and clam here was smooth and briny—nothing like what I’d had before.
Now I understand why people say <strong>oysters are addictive</strong>.</p>
