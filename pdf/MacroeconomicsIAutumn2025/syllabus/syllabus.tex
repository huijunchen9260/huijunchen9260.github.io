\section*{Grading Policy}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Grading Policy}

% \subsection*{Quizzes / Exams}
% \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Quizzes / Exams}

% Weekly quizzes in this class: \underline{Calculus materials}.
% You will have \textbf{unlimited} attempts and \textbf{unlimited time} per attempt for quizzes of Calculus materials.
% When calculating the final grade, I will \textbf{drop two quiz with the lowest grade} in each category (except Quiz on Calculus, Ch. 10 \& 11).

% The exact due date and time for quizzes and exams should refer to the schedule below and the setting on Carmen.
% In principle, all quizzes are due on \textbf{Sunday 11:59pm}, and the answer is available on \textbf{next Monday}.

% Late quizzes are not accepted, unless you have formal excuse (require formal documentation, and the \textbf{instrutor still has rights to decide whether to extend the quiz / exams for this excuse}).

% Final exam are cumulative, so the content from the midterm is also included in final exam.

% \section*{Quizzes and Examinations Integrity Policies}
% \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Quizzes and Examinations Integrity Policies}
\section*{Examinations Integrity Policies}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Examinations Integrity Policies}

\textbf{Problem Sets}: Discussions are \textbf{encouraged}, but each person must hand in their own answer sheets

\textbf{Examinations}: Discussions are \textbf{forbidden}, either face to face or via online discussion board / Social media.

% \subsection*{Extra credits}

% Extra credits: At the end of the semester, I will have you do the Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI). If I get $80\%$ response rate on SEI by the end of the semester, everyone will get 2 points of extra credits.

\subsection*{Curving}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Curving}

If less than $40\%$ of the students get A- or above, I will add some points to everybody until $40\%$ of the students get A- or above, but I don't expect this to occur.

\subsection*{Problem Sets}
\label{sub:Problem_Sets}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Problem Sets}

There are four problem sets and each of them worth 5 points.
The way to calculate semester grade on problem set is by $ \frac{ \texttt{correct answers} }{ \texttt{total number of questions} } \times 5 $.
For example, if there are 36 questions and you answer 30 correctly, then you will get $ \frac{30}{36} \times 5 \approx 4.16$ points in semester grade.


Problem sets will be answered on paper, and will be submitted by the class time to TA.

Note that overdue assignment will \textbf{NOT} be accepted.

\subsection*{Exam}
\label{sub:Exam}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Exam}

There are two midterm exams and each of them worth 20 points.
There is one final exam and it worths 30 points.
The way to calculate semester grade on exams is the similar to the Problem Sets if not otherwise noted.

\subsection*{Attendance}
\label{sub:Attendance}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Attendance}

If there are more than $ 50\% $ of students attend the class, then I will not take attendance.
If I have not taken attendance until the end of semester, then every students will be granted the entirety of the attendance points.
If I start to take attendance, then I will spread $ 5 $ to $ 10 $ attendance check across the rest of the semester, and the attendance points will be recorded accordingly.


% \subsection*{Midterm \& Final weight change}
% \label{sub:Midterm____Final_weight_change}
% \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Midterm \& Final weight change}

% After the midterm exam, there will be a survey on Carmen asking whether you want to change the weight between midterm and final from $ 35 $ points each to $ 10 $ points for midterm and $ 60 $ points for final.
% This survey will due \textbf{before} the final exam date, and you cannot change the weight between midterm and final after you took the final exam.


% \section*{Course Attendance Policy}

% According to the new ASC policy, \textbf{strictly masking} is required, which means you should wear your mask to cover your mouth and nose.
% Also, the students \textbf{are not allowed to eat or drink} in class.

% The definition of in-person class also redefined by new ASC policy.
% Up to \textbf{24\%} of the class meetings can be online.
% If I cannot teach the course in person due to personal issue, I will make an announcement on \href{https://osu.instructure.com/courses/114824}{Carmen}, and the class will be held online in the \href{https://osu.zoom.us/j/2532324996?pwd=c2cweEphWFMvTVZreHJ0MHNRNUdodz09}{zoom link}.

% The instructor is also required to make reasonable accommodations for students who cannot attend the classes for a period of time, either because of sickness or quarantine.
% My arrangement is to open all my class recordings back in the summer in the \href{https://huijunchen9260.github.io/PrincipleMacroSpring2022.html}{Webpage} so that students who cannot come to class can also reach out the course materials by watching the recorded videos.
% Also, since the office hour is online, those students who cannot attend the in-person meeting can also ask me question on the \href{https://osu.zoom.us/j/2532324996?pwd=c2cweEphWFMvTVZreHJ0MHNRNUdodz09}{zoom link}.
