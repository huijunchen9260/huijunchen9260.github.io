    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Corporate tax deductions are widely employed as countercyclical policies, yet their impact on the business cycle and interactions with other policies remain largely understudied.
    I examine the cyclical implications of such deductions by developing a novel dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in which firms face credit market imperfections and idiosyncratic productivity shocks.
    In my model, firms' investment decisions are distorted by collateralized borrowing and corporate taxation, and investment expenditures can be deducted from taxable income through targeted or untargeted accelerated depreciation policies.
    My model quantitatively replicates empirical estimates of the distribution of short-run elasticities of investment across firm size to changes in deduction policies.
    I show that raising deductions can reduce the severity and persistence of recessions by alleviating capital misallocation for productive firms.
    Applying my model to the policies in the US 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, I find that the targeted policy is 30 percent more effective than the untargeted policy in stimulating aggregate output.
    Furthermore, combining both policies reduces the overall effectiveness by 17 percent, revealing potential inefficiencies in current US tax policy implementation.

    I study how much financial frictions and the endogeneity of partially irreversible capital explain the slow recovery of the Great Recession.
    I propose a heterogeneous firm model with real and financial frictions.
    Firms adjust their capital stock by trading on the used capital market; thus, the capital partial irreversibility is endogenized by the price in the market.
    This irreversibility creates two opposite forces affecting investment volatility.
    First, capital investment is relatively cheaper in the recession, and thus attracts firms to invest in capital, dampening the fall of aggregate investment.
    Second, in a downturn, the capital becomes less reversible, and investments become riskier, exacerbating the fall of aggregate investment.
    In my model, the collateral constraint is procyclical since it is based on the resale value of the capital, and thus amplifies the first force and dampens the response of aggregate investment.
    I found that in the steady state, the used capital market induces firms to stay financially constrained due to lower effective capital prices.
    This status however may put these firms in a vulnerable position when the value of their collateral drops during a recession, as they heavily depend on debt to finance their capital investment.
    However, the perfect foresight exercise shows that the time-varying collateral constraint channel is relatively small.
    The main channel lies in the used capital market price, which acts as an automatic stabilizer during the credit crisis.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Loan-to-value ratio (LTV) ceiling is a government policy that puts a cap on households' mortgages relative to their house value, often intended to reduce booms in house prices.
    This paper studies the effects of this policy on house prices, using a simple two-period overlapping-generations model featuring within-generation inequality.
    In contrast to popular belief, we find that a strict (low) loan-to-value ratio ceiling raises long-run house prices, as lenders respond to the policy by substituting from mortgage lending to purchasing more houses.
    The policy's positive effect on house prices is more severe with greater inequality.
    A strict ceiling is especially harmful to the poor.
    Taxes can only intensify the positive effect on house prices, although they can mitigate the adverse effects on welfare.
