    Corporate tax deductions are widely employed as countercyclical policies, yet their impact on the business cycle and interactions with other policies remain largely understudied.
    I examine the cyclical implications of such deductions by developing a novel dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model in which firms face credit market imperfections and idiosyncratic productivity shocks.
    In my model, firms' investment decisions are distorted by collateralized borrowing and corporate taxation, and investment expenditures can be deducted from taxable income through targeted or untargeted accelerated depreciation policies.
    My model quantitatively replicates empirical estimates of the distribution of short-run elasticities of investment across firm size to changes in deduction policies.
    I show that raising deductions can reduce the severity and persistence of recessions by alleviating capital misallocation for productive firms.
    Applying my model to the policies in the US 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, I find that the targeted policy is 30 percent more effective than the untargeted policy in stimulating aggregate output.
    Furthermore, combining both policies reduces the overall effectiveness by 17 percent, revealing potential inefficiencies in current US tax policy implementation.

This paper studies the business cycle implications of the interaction between secondary capital markets and credit market imperfections in a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms.
In the model, prices in secondary capital markets affect the economy through two key channels: changes in the cost of investment and fluctuations in the resale value of collateral.
The results show that price adjustments in secondary markets amplify the severity and duration of recessions triggered by financial shocks.
The rise in investment costs driven by financial shocks deepens the recessionary trough by a factor of three compared to the effect of collateral value fluctuations.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Loan-to-value ratio (LTV) ceiling is a government policy that puts a cap on households' mortgages relative to their house value, often intended to reduce booms in house prices.
    This paper studies the effects of this policy on house prices, using a simple two-period overlapping-generations model featuring within-generation inequality.
    In contrast to popular belief, we find that a strict (low) loan-to-value ratio ceiling raises long-run house prices, as lenders respond to the policy by substituting from mortgage lending to purchasing more houses.
    The policy's positive effect on house prices is more severe with greater inequality.
    A strict ceiling is especially harmful to the poor.
    Taxes can only intensify the positive effect on house prices, although they can mitigate the adverse effects on welfare.
