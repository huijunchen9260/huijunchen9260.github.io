<p><strong>Date:</strong> June 16, 2025 — <em>New York City, New York</em></p>
<p>Peter Luger Steak House is a legendary spot in Brooklyn, New York.
This was my first time dining there. It used to hold a Michelin star, but lost it in 2022 due to inconsistent food quality, according to <a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1756619/peter-luger-steak-house-pete-wells-not-impressed/">this article</a>.
Despite all the criticism, I personally had a great experience.</p>
<p>As the photos show, the interior is luxurious and traditional:</p>

<p>We were seated at a table by the window.
Somehow, the view outside looked even better from inside this historic restaurant.</p>

<p>I hadn’t done much research ahead of time, but when I saw a sausage lunch special on the menu, I realized this is actually a German-style steakhouse.
You can also tell from the decorations on the wall:</p>

<p>Our waiter was kind and professional—he only spoke when needed, but always helpful.
Right after we placed our order, a basket of bread arrived along with their signature steak sauce.
The sauce had a cocktail-like flavor to it, and I really enjoyed it.</p>

<p>We started with bacon and Caesar salad as appetizers.
The bacon was amazing—not overly salty like supermarket bacon, and thick enough to really taste the meat.
It was so good I decided to order the sausage lunch special right after.
The Caesar salad was also well done, and not overly salty like many other steakhouses tend to make it.</p>

<p>For the main course, we got the steak for two—a porterhouse that includes both filet mignon and New York strip.
I really liked how they presented it.
The waiter propped one side of the sizzling hot platter with a small upside-down dish to angle it toward the sunlight, making the steak glisten.
Then came the classic Peter Luger touch: he used two spoons to plate one piece of filet and one piece of strip onto each dish, along with some clarified butter.</p>
<p>The steak was tender and juicy, served perfectly medium-rare at first.
Since the platter was still hot, the rest of the steak continued to cook and reached medium over time—but it stayed juicy throughout.</p>

<p>The sausage had no pepper or heavy seasoning—just a clean, meaty flavor.
Personally, I preferred it without the Dijon mustard.</p>

<p>The meal ended with some chocolates:</p>

<p>To sum up, I really enjoyed the entire meal.
Our waiter was friendly and even made a few jokes, which added to the atmosphere.
(Interestingly, the waiters at nearby tables seemed more reserved.)
The steak was fabulous. I truly believe the porterhouse is a must-have at Peter Luger—or maybe even a must-have if you’re visiting NYC.</p>
