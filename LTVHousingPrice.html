<p>Loan-to-value ratio (LTV) ceiling is a government policy that puts a cap on households&#8217; mortgages relative to their house value, often intended to reduce booms in house prices.
This paper studies the effects of this policy on house prices, using a simple two-period overlapping-generations model featuring within-generation inequality.
In contrast to popular belief, we find that a strict (low) loan-to-value ratio ceiling raises long-run house prices, as lenders respond to the policy by substituting from mortgage lending to purchasing more houses.
The policy&#8217;s positive effect on house prices is more severe with greater inequality.
A strict ceiling is especially harmful to the poor.
Taxes can only intensify the positive effect on house prices, although they can mitigate the adverse effects on welfare.</p>
